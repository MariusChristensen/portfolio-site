              This website is from a Project Exam at Noroff. We were meant to make a blog-site about any topic we
              wanted. We needed to make the site from the ground up with basic HTML, CSS and JS, but fetching all the
              blog-posts and media from the Wordpress REST API.

              This website is from our cross-course project at Noroff where we were to create an e-commerce site for a
              company selling jackets. Throughout the year, we have updated this site based on the things we have learnt
              along the way. Starting with just basic HTML&CSS and before moving over to using more complicated things
              to make a workable website
